Things I Noticed / Can test for:

Defining on when endgame starts and how chainging it effects things,
(queens are gone / one player only has X total value of pieces left, etc )

Adding search depth based off how many total pieces are left

Timing differenes between with and without pruning

How much piece square tables help

How much opening lookup tables help

How much evalutating your oppoenent position matters
(more:)
( I found that using the same evalutaion on position causes agent to sacrifice peices for the 
sake of a worse postion for the oppoenent, so I "watered down" their positoin eval a bit )

How checking for three_fold_repition helps with time
(It supposedly takes decent time, but if checking that prunes away enough braches it could be beneficial )
( -Found that checking at the top level only is beneficial, and that checking at each level takes too long, but checking at the top
is beneficial for both positioning and for time)

How penaltizing checkmates that take longer helped 
(more:)
(it would always pick the first checkmate path it saw, so If it saw a checkmate in 3 moves, it pick that, then on it's next turn 
it could find a new way to check mate in three moves again, then on it's next turn same thing find a new way to checkmate in 3, thus entering a 
infinite loop and never checkmating)

Using the wierd ass value tables instead of usual [1, 3, 3, 5, 9, 0]

Using an endgame table in addition to a midgame table
